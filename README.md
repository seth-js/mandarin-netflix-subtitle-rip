# mandarin-netflix-subtitle-rip
 This is a rip of 109 Mandarin TV Shows/Movies with Traditional Chinese subtitles.

 I went to <a href="https://www.unogs.com">uNoGS</a>, and looked up shows with Mandarin audio and Traditional Chinese subtitles.
 
 I went through most of the shows and movies on the list, there are about 140 of them (as of 8-20-21). I skipped some to save time.
 
 I used <a href="https://github.com/Tithen-Firion/UserScripts">Tithen-Firion's Netflix subtitle downloader</a> to grab all the subs.

 unique.json has every word encountered in these subtitles. I created this using <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/chinese-tokenizer">chinese-tokenizer</a>.
 
 This JSON file should be useful for creating a frequency list.
 
 All words are in traditional form, if you want to convert them to simplified, I recommend <a href="https://github.com/BYVoid/OpenCC">OpenCC</a>.
